# Seedling randomizer creation framework



This is a template of a basic video game randomizer using Python and Django, put together by tetraly.

It's largely based off the work of Dorkmaster Flek (SMRPG randomizer) and Veetorp (Link to the Past ranromizer)

If you have questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to tetraly@ on Twitter or tetraly#1131 on Discord.
