            <p>Playing a
                randomizer seed on original hardware requires a "flash cart", which is a special cartridge designed for that
                hardware that allows you to put the randomized ROM on some kind of portable flash memory (usually an SD
                or MicroSD card) which is inserted into the flash cart, which then goes in the original console.</p>
